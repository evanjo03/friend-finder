## Purpose
The application takes survey results and compares them to others who have taken the survey to determine the closest match based on similar answers to a set of ten questions.  The application was really helpful in furthering my understanding of the full-stack process, implementing routing via express, a node.js server, and modularization to organize the different elements of our front and back-end.
